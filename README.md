# Game Of Life
It is a simulation of Conway's Game Of Life

The Game of Life belongs to a class of applications called Generative. With generative apps we typically set up initial conditions ( like we set here is GOL begining with live/dead cells) and then let an algorithm drive the behaviour from there. Generative apps generate results that are interesting and often surprising.
